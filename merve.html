            <h2 class="mb-3">PROFESSIONS OF THE FUTURE</h2>
            <p align=justify>The only thing that doesn't change is change. While the world is changing, current professions are changing so that we can meet our needs in the most logical way. Here, the future professions, which are foreseen depending on the course of technology and the world, are also of great importance.Occupations that do not exist today may occupy large areas in the future. To know the popular professions of the future; it will help you plan a better career and have more professional confidence. When we look back, we see that some professions have disappeared and new professions have emerged.Many of the professions of tomorrow will most likely be the products of scientific and technological advances made today. Many of today's professions will continue to exist in the future, but of course, like everything else, these professions will take their share of change.Some professional professions will either turn into something completely different or disappear. Many of us are programmed to resist change and suspense. We may feel very satisfied with the situation and find it safe, but most of the professions that exist now are full and new jobs are needed. In addition, the increase in the number of university graduates day by day makes it difficult to find a job. For this reason, candidates should focus on departments with higher job opportunities. Candidates who are concerned about finding a job should search for sectors and popular professions that will come to the forefront in the future. We must foresee the developing and changing world and develop ourselves accordingly.The high number of university graduates, the capacity of most professions today, and the inability of these professions to keep up with the needs of the age cause unemployment. The best solution to unemployment is to promote the professions of the future.Thus, young people can learn new professions, job opportunities of these professions. There is no need for much capital for this solution. Therefore, it is the easiest solution to implement. It is the ideal way to encourage young people to the professions of the future. The orientation towards future professions has also been influential in the past. For example, when the Wright brothers made a successful flight for the first time with their aircraft in 1903, the aviation industry was at the top of the future professions for that period.Over the next ten to 15 years, the adoption of automation and AI technologies will transform the workplace as people increasingly interact with ever-smarter machines. These technologies, and that human-machine interaction, will bring numerous benefits in the form of higher productivity, GDP growth, improved corporate performance, and new prosperity, but they will also change the skills required of human workers.(McKinsey & Company ).All technological skills, both advanced and basic, will see a substantial growth in demand. Advanced technologies require people who understand how they work and can innovate, develop, and adapt them. While rapid advances in technology are replaced by autonomous systems and artificial intelligence in many areas in the business world, digitization will leave 7.6 million people unemployed by 2030. It is pointed out that if the current employment of 28 million has reached 33.3 million in 10 years and digitalization is used efficiently, additional employment of 8.9 million can be created.It is envisaged to create a new employment of 1.8 million people with new professions to emerge during this period. (McKinseyCompany). According to this research, employment will be created for people turning to new professions, but those who cannot keep up with the professions of the period will remain unemployed.Canada was the first country to publish its national AI strategy. Pan-Canada Artificial Intelligence Strategy, which is discussed in detail in the 2017 federal budget, is a 5-year and 125 million Canadian budget to invest in artificial intelligence research and the development of the skills of researchers working in this field.The strategy has four objectives: One is to increase the number of AI researchers and graduates (Şaşmaz,2018).Thus, investments are made to develop the skills of those who turn to new business fields such as artificial intelligence. The aim of this plan is to increase the number of graduates of artificial intelligence.The world needs people who are trained in these new areas.There is an employment gap in these areas.With the introduction of the professions of the future, young people will meet these jobs with employment and the unemployment problem will disappear.</p>
			<p align=justify>While adapting the solution to our local problem, we should pay attention to the student portfolio in our country.This solution is feasible and realistic. The part we will have difficulty with is this: Students in our country may not be brave to turn to new professions, because these professions are not preferred and tried before. Young people may hesitate while choosing these professions.Young people in our country prefer more known and familiar professions.For this reason, in order to adapt this solution to our country, besides promoting the professions of the future, it can provide incentives to those who prefer these professions.This increases the courage of young people. In this solution, voluntary organizations and educational foundations will be responsible.Foundations will finance this solution.Volunteer organizations will play a role in the publication of the promotion.It may take a long time to see the results of this solution.Because it takes time for young people to abandon their familiar professions and turn to new professions.We will see the results of this solution when young people look at new jobs positively and start to succeed.</p>
